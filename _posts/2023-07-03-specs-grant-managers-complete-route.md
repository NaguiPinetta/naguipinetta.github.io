# Grant Managers Ability to Complete Routes

## Goal
Allow Manager 7 users to execute route actions such as:
- START ROUTE
- DEPART FROM ORIGIN
- CANCEL ALL STOPS
- ARRIVE AT DESTINATION
- COMPLETE ROUTE

## Background and Strategic Fits
- Manager users usually bump into a very common scenario where routes are not finished by their assigned drivers, and they need to take care of it. In doing so, they must contact a system administrator/dispatcher (Live user) and request them to complete such routes.
- The Manager application could become really handy if it allowed supervisors to execute all necessary route actions.

### Assumptions
- Manager 7 users usually see themselves in the need of completing (closing) a route during service. This is due to several reasons, from the driver's GPS signal was lost or simply because they didn¬¥t follow the right procedures.

## Requirements
### 1# - Add Route Actions button at Route Details screen
#### User Story
As a Manager user, I would like to be able to access a section on the app where I can perform route actions available on Live.

#### Prototype

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Route Actions button must be available on every route's details.
- When tapping Route Actions button, the user must be redirected to Route Actions screens.

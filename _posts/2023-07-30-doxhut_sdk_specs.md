# <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut SDK Specification</span>

## <span style="color: #000000">Introduction</span>

- Currently, <span style="color: #00008B">pepsico-ru</span> drivers utilize the <span style="color: #00008B">iSales</span> mobile application to manage their routes and handle delivery-related tasks. To streamline their operations and enhance efficiency, we aim to integrate their existing <span style="color: #A52A2A">ERP</span> route import solution with <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut</span>. To achieve this, we will create a robust API structure that facilitates seamless integration between their <span style="color: #A52A2A">ERP</span> system and <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut</span>.

- Additionally, we will develop a <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut SDK</span>, which will enable their <span style="color: #00008B">iSales</span> app to interact with specific endpoints on the <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut API</span>.

## <span style="color: #000000">DoxHut SDK - Library - Methods</span>

### <span style="color: #000000">Start Route</span>

**Goal**<br>
<br>
- Start a route from a host application on the <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut Server</span> via the <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut Engine</span>.

**Background and Strategic Fits**<br>
<br>
- On <span style="color: #00008B">pepsico-ru</span>, routes are currently initiated from the origin using the <span style="color: #00008B">iSales</span> app.
- Currently, routes are imported from <span style="color: #A52A2A">ERP</span> into <span style="color: #00008B">iSales</span>.

**Assumptions**<br>
<br>
- Routes will be imported from <span style="color: #A52A2A">ERP</span> to <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut</span>, containing all necessary information for successful loading on both the host app and <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut Engine</span>.
- System administrators will configure and maintain driver configurations, permissions, and route action restrictions on <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut Live</span>.
<br>
<br>
#### <span style="color: #A52A2A">Requirements</span>

- Make it possible for <span style="color: #00008B">Pepsico RU</span> drivers to start routes from a host app to the <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut Server</span> via the <span style="color: #00008B">DoxHut Engine</span>.
<br>
<br>
#### <span style="color: #A52A2A">User Story</span>

<br>
<br>
#### <span style="color: #A52A2A">DoxHut Engine Method</span>

- Starts the route loaded by the user and changes its status to <span style="color: #A52A2A">"in progress"</span>.

**Throws:**
- <span style="color: #A52A2A">TenantNotDefinedException</span> when no tenant has been informed.
- <span style="color: #A52A2A">NoRouteLoadedException</span> when no route has been loaded.
- <span style="color: #A52A2A">RouteAlreadyStartedException</span> when the route has already been started.
- <span style="color: #A52A2A">NetworkErrorException</span> when it was not possible to establish communication with the server.
<br>
<br>
> <span style="color: #00008B">Note</span>: Communication interruptions, lack of connectivity, or when the server is down may cause <span style="color: #A52A2A">NetworkErrorException</span>.

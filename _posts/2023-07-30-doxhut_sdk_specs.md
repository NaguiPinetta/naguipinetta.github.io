# DoxHut SDK Documentation

## Introduction

Currently, **pepsico-ru** drivers utilize the **iSales** mobile application to manage their routes and handle delivery-related tasks. To streamline their operations and enhance efficiency, we aim to integrate their existing ERP route import solution with **DoxHut**. To achieve this, we will create a robust API structure that facilitates seamless integration between their **ERP** system and **DoxHut**. <br>

Additionally, we will develop a **DoxHut SDK**, which will enable their **iSales** app to interact with specific endpoints on the **DoxHut API**.

### **DoxHut Driver Flow**

## DoxHut SDK - Library - Methods

### Start Route

**Goal**

- Start a route from a host application on the **DoxHut Server** via the **DoxHut Engine**.<br>

**Background and Strategic Fits**

- On **pepsico-ru**, routes are currently initiated from the origin using the **iSales** app.
- Currently, routes are imported from **ERP** into **iSales**.<br>

**Assumptions**

- Routes will be imported from **ERP** to **DoxHut**, containing all necessary information for successful loading on both the host app and **DoxHut Engine**.
- System administrators will configure and maintain driver configurations, permissions, and route action restrictions on **DoxHut Live**.

#### **Requirements**

- Make it possible for **Pepsico RU** drivers to start routes from a host app to the **DoxHut Server** via the **DoxHut Engine**.

#### **User Story**

As an **iSales** user from **Pepsico RU**'s operation, I need to be able to start routes.

#### **DoxHut Engine Method**

- Starts the route loaded by the user and changes its status to **"in progress"**.<br>

**Throws:**
- **TenantNotDefinedException** when no tenant has been informed.
- **NoRouteLoadedExceptio**n when no route has been loaded.
- **RouteAlreadyStartedException** when the route has already been started.
- **NetworkErrorException** when it was not possible to establish communication with the server. <br>
<br>
> **Note**: This may be due to a communication error, lack of connectivity, or when the server is down.<br>

##### **Flow**

###### Success Scenario 1 - Successfully start route

- It is called **DoxHutEngine.startRoute** successfully.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must have loaded the route previously.
- The driver must not have started the route previously.<br>

###### Failure Scenario 1 - Network error 

- It is called **DoxHutEngine.startRoute** then **NetworkErrorException**.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.<br>

###### Failure Scenario 2 - No route loaded

- It is called **DoxHutEngine.startRoute** then **NoRouteLoadedException**.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must not have loaded the route previously.<br>

###### Failure Scenario 3 - Route already started

- It is called **DoxHutEngine.startRoute** then **RouteAlreadyStartedException**.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must have loaded the route previously.
- The driver must not have started the route previously.<br>

##### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Verify if the route status changes to **STARTED** after executing the start route action.
- Verify if any other route changes its status to **STARTED** after the execution of this action.
- Verify that this method uses the **Request Queue** properly.<br>

### Complete Route

**Goal**

- Complete routes from a host application on the **DoxHut Server** via the **DoxHut Engine**.<br>

**Background and Strategic Fits**

- On **pepsico-ru** operation, routes are currently departed from the origin using the **iSales** app.
- Currently, routes are imported from **ERP** into **iSales**.<br>

**Assumptions**

- Routes will be imported from **ERP** to **DoxHut**, containing all necessary information for successful loading on both the host app and **DoxHut Engine**.
- System administrators will configure and maintain driver configurations, permissions, and route action restrictions on **DoxHut Live**.

#### **Requirements**

- Make it possible for **Pepsico RU** drivers to complete routes from a host app to the **DoxHut Server** via the **DoxHut Engine**.<br>

#### **User Story**

As an **iSales** user from **Pepsico RU**'s operation, I need to be able to inform the **DoxHut Engine** when I complete a route.<br>

#### **DoxHut Engine Method**

- Action input by the driver or system administrator to indicate the route has been completed. Note: This is the final action in the route and can only be performed once the driver arrived at the destination and all stops are in a status different than **"pending"**.<br>

**Throws:**
- **TenantNotDefinedException** when no tenant has been informed.
- **StillNotArrivedAtDestination** when the action **"Arrive at Destination"** has not been performed.
- **NoRouteLoadedException** when no route has been loaded.
- **NetworkErrorException** when it was not possible to establish communication with the server.<br>
  
> **Note**: this may be due to a communication error, lack of connectivity, or when the server is down.<br>

#### **Flow**

##### **Success Scenario 1 - It is called DoxHutEngine.completeRoute with success**

**Requirements:**
- The driver must have previously executed the **Arrive at Destination** method.
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must have loaded the route previously.<br>

##### **Failure Scenario 1 - Network error**
- It is called **DoxHutEngine.completeRoute**, then **NetworkErrorException** is thrown.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must not be able to communicate with the server.<br>

##### **Failure Scenario 2 - No route loaded**
- It is called **DoxHutEngine.completeRoute**, then **NoRouteLoadedException** is thrown.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must not have loaded the route previously.<br>

##### **Failure Scenario 3 - Still not arrived at the destination**
- It is called **DoxHutEngine.completeRoute**, then **tillNotArrivedAtDestination** is thrown.<br>

**Requirements:**
- The driver must have not previously executed the **Arrive at Destination** method.
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must have loaded the route previously.<br>

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Verify if the route status changes to **COMPLETED** after executing the complete route action.
- Verify if any other route changes its status to **COMPLETED** after the execution of this action.
- Make sure it is not possible to complete the route without having previously executed the **Arrive at Destination** method.<br>

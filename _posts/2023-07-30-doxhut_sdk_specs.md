# DoxHut SDK Documentation

The **DoxHut SDK** is a powerful library designed to facilitate seamless integration between the iSales application used in **Pepsico RU**'s operation and the **DoxHut** system. By leveraging the **DoxHut SDK** methods, users can efficiently manage routes, initiate route plans, and complete routes directly from the **iSales** app. This documentation provides an in-depth guide to utilizing the **DoxHut SDK** and its key functionalities.

## DoxHut SDK - Library - Methods

### **Goal**

- Build an API to integrate with **iSales** in **Pepsico RU**'s operation.

### **Background and Strategic Fits**

Currently, **Pepsico RU**'s drivers use the **iSales** application to manage their routes and perform delivery-related activities. The goal is to import the routes from **SAP** into **DoxHut**, while the users continue to utilize the **iSales** app.

### **Assumptions** 

- **iSales** users will continue to use the application, while the routes will be imported into **DoxHut**.

### **Requirements**

- Build an API to integrate with **iSales** in **Pepsico RU**'s operation.

## DoxHut SDK - Methods - Start Route

### **Goal**

- Start a route from a host application on the **DoxHut Server** via the **DoxHut Engine**.

### **Background and Strategic Fits**

- On **Pepsico RU** operation, routes are currently departed from origin on **iSales** app.
- Currently routes are imported from **SAP** into **iSales**.

### **Assumptions**

- Routes will be imported from **SAP** to **DoxHut** and will contain all necessary information for successful loading on both the host app and **DoxHut Engine**.
- System administrators will set up and maintain the driver's configurations on **DoxHut Live**, such as permissions and restrictions of route actions.

### **Requirements**

- Make it possible for **Pepsico RU** drivers to start routes from a host app to the **DoxHut Server** via the **DoxHut Engine**.

### **User Story**

As an **iSales** user from **Pepsico RU**'s operation, I need to be able to start routes.

### **DoxHut Engine Method**

- Starts the route loaded by the user and changes its status to **"in progress"**.<br>

**Throws:**
- **TenantNotDefinedException** when no tenant has been informed.
- **NoRouteLoadedExceptio**n when no route has been loaded.
- **RouteAlreadyStartedException** when the route has already been started.
- **NetworkErrorException** when it was not possible to establish communication with the server. <br>
<br>

> **Note**: This may be due to a communication error, lack of connectivity, or when the server is down.<br>

> **Note**: This method uses the request queue.

### **Flow**

#### Success Scenario 1 - Successfully start route

- It is called **DoxHutEngine.startRoute** with success<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must have loaded the route previously.
- The driver must not have started the route previously.<br>

#### Failure Scenario 1 - Network error 

- It is called **DoxHutEngine.startRoute** then **NetworkErrorException**.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.<br>

#### Failure Scenario 2 - No route loaded

- It is called **DoxHutEngine.startRoute** then **NoRouteLoadedException**.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must not have loaded the route previously.<br>

#### Failure Scenario 3 - Route already started

- It is called **DoxHutEngine.startRoute** then **RouteAlreadyStartedException**.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must have loaded the route previously.
- The driver must not have started the route previously.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Verify if the route status changes to **STARTED** after executing the start route action.
- Verify if any other route changes its status to **STARTED** after the execution of this action.
- Verify that this method uses the **Request Queue** properly.

## DoxHut SDK - Methods - Complete Route

### **Goal**

- Complete routes from a host application on the **DoxHut Server** via the **DoxHut Engine**.

### **Background and Strategic Fits**

- On **Pepsico RU** operation, routes are currently departed from origin on **iSales** app.
- Currently routes are imported from **SAP** into **iSales**.

### **Assumptions**

- Routes will be imported from **SAP** to **DoxHut** and will contain all necessary information for successful loading on both the host app and **DoxHut Engine**.
- System administrators will set up and maintain the driver's configurations on **DoxHut Live**, such as permissions and restrictions of route actions.

### **Requirements**

- Make it possible for **Pepsico RU** drivers to complete routes from a host app to the **DoxHut Server** via the **DoxHut Engine**.

### **User Story**

As an **iSales** user from **Pepsico RU**'s operation, I need to be able to inform the **DoxHut Engine** when I complete a route.

### **DoxHut Engine Method**

- Action input by the driver or system administrator to indicate the route has been completed. Note: This is the final action in the route and can only be performed once the driver arrived at the destination and all stops are in a status different than **"pending"**.<br>

**Throws:**
- **TenantNotDefinedException** when no tenant has been informed.
- **StillNotArrivedAtDestination** when the action **"Arrive at Destination"** has not been performed.
- **NoRouteLoadedException** when no route has been loaded.
- **NetworkErrorException** when it was not possible to establish communication with the server. 
  
> **Note**: this may be due to a communication error, lack of connectivity, or when the server is down.

### **Flow**

#### **Success Scenario 1 - It is called DoxHutEngine.completeRoute with success**

**Requirements:**
- The driver must have previously executed the **Arrive at Destination** method.
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must have loaded the route previously.<br>

#### **Failure Scenario 1 - Network error**
- It is called **DoxHutEngine.completeRoute**, then **NetworkErrorException** is thrown.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must not be able to communicate with the server.

#### **Failure Scenario 2 - No route loaded**
- It is called **DoxHutEngine.completeRoute**, then **NoRouteLoadedException** is thrown.<br>

**Requirements:**
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must not have loaded the route previously.<br>

#### **Failure Scenario 3 - Still not arrived at the destination**
- It is called **DoxHutEngine.completeRoute**, then **tillNotArrivedAtDestination** is thrown.<br>

**Requirements:**
- The driver must have not previously executed the **Arrive at Destination** method.
- It must be able to communicate with the server.
- The driver must have loaded the route previously.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Verify if the route status changes to **COMPLETED** after executing the complete route action.
- Verify if any other route changes its status to **COMPLETED** after the execution of this action.
- Make sure it is not possible to complete the route without having previously executed the **Arrive at Destination** method.
